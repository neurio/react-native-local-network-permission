# Example

This example app demonstrates how to use the library. Since this library is targeted towards
a native capability of iOS, you need to run the example app on a physical iOS device.

## Usage

To run the example app, clone the repo and navigate to the `example` directory.

Now start the metro server using `yarn start`.

Then, in a separate terminal, run `yarn ios --device` to build and run the app on a physical
iOS device. You can select your device if you connected it to your laptop with a physical cable.
